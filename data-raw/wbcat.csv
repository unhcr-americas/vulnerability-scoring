"Corporate Scorecard 2013 Indicators","CSC2013","<p>The Corporate Scorecard 2013 was designed to provide a snapshot of the Bank's overall performance, including its business modernization, in the context of development results. This archived version has been superseded by a re-designed Corporate Scorecard for 2014 (pdf only).</p>
<p>The World Bank has systems—on which it continuously improves—for measuring and monitoring both development results and its own performance. These systems are complemented by independent evaluations. With the Results Measurement System, which was adopted for the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA13) in 2002, the Bank became the first multilateral development institution to use a framework with quantitative indicators to monitor results and performance. The Corporate Scorecard expanded this approach to the entire World Bank covering both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and IDA. The Corporate Scorecard 2013 used an integrated results and performance framework, which was organized in a four-tier structure that grouped indicators along the results chain. Two of the tiers tracked elements of development results (Tiers I and II), and the other two captured elements of performance (Tiers III and IV). The Corporate Scorecard 2013 monitored, at an aggregate level, whether the Bank was functioning efficiently and adapting itself successfully (Tier IV), and whether it was managing its operations and services effectively (Tier III) to support countries in achieving results (Tier II) in the context of global development progress and priorities (Tier I). It presented a high-level view and was not intended to provide country- or activity-level information.</p>",NA,"Time series","English","Annual","WLD, EAP, ECA, LAC, MNA, SAS, SSA, HIC, LMY, IBRD, IDA","National, Regional","185","Public Sector, Trade","No further updates planned",NA,"20-Dec-2013","data@worldbank.org","Bulk download","Corporate Scorecard Indicators=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/Corporate-Scorecard-Tier1-2-3-4.zip=zip;World Bank Corporate Scorecard 2013 (PDF) (994 KB)=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/World%20Bank%20Corporate%20Scorecard.pdf=PDF","Corporate Scorecard 2013, The World Bank","http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/corporate-scorecard-2013-indicators","12","1990 - 2012","0",NA,NA,"Data availability (number of economies, start and end date, and granularity) varies by tier.

"Service Delivery Indicators","SDI","<p>The Service Delivery Indicators program is an application of the principles of the 2004 World Development Report Making Services Work for Poor People. The Service Delivery Indicators project is a new Africa-wide initiative that tracks service delivery in education and health across countries and over time.</p>
<p>The project collects nationally representative data that focus mainly on performance and quality of service delivery in primary schools and at frontline health facilities. This partnership between the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the African Economic Research Consortium brings together development economists and sector specialists. The objective is to reposition the dialogue on human development in Africa within the context of effectiveness of public spending and accountability for service delivery. Why such an agenda? Accountability for public resources: developing country governments allocate roughly a third of budgets to education and health. Demands for accountability for the efficient use of public resources—from citizens and tax payers in developed or developing countries alike—are gaining in prominence, in part, because of the global economic situation. Accountability depends upon measurement: without consistent and accurate information on the quality of services, it is difficult for citizens or politicians to assess how service providers are performing, to work towards corrective action, and ultimately bring about improvements. There is little robust and representative evidence of what teachers and health workers do during a typical work-day, their levels of ability, knowledge and skills, how teachers perform their teaching activities and how well health workers diagnose and treat their patients.</p>","http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/service-delivery-indicators","Time Series",NA,"Annual","SSA, LMY, IDA","Other (Facility)","8","Education, Health","No fixed schedule","No fixed schedule","11-Jan-2017","sdi@worldbank.org","Bulk download, Query tool","SDI (Excel) - ZIP (79 KB)=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/SDI_excel.zip=zip;SDI (CSV) - ZIP (22 KB)=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/SDI_csv.zip=zip","Service Delivery Indicators, The World Bank","http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/service-delivery-indicators","16","2010 - 2016","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda",NA,NA

"Wealth Accounting",NA,"<p>Wealth Accounting supplements macroeconomic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), by measuring the comprehensive wealth of a country. While changes in GDP tell us if growth is occurring, changes in wealth (i.e., saving rate) tell us if growth is sustainable-that is, whether it is long-term. So, just as private companies are assessed by looking at both income and balance sheets, countries need to start accounting for wealth and not just income. </p>
<p>For the past 15 years, the World Bank’s Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice has implemented a program to systematically measure comprehensive wealth, to include natural resources, human, and social capital, along with physical capital.  This work program provides indicators that measure the sustainability of a country’s growth path: some indicators are published annually, such as Adjusted Net Saving (ANS) and adjusted Net National Income (aNNI), while the comprehensive wealth accounts were published in 2011.  Related annual indicators also include natural resource rents, which underlie the wealth accounting data.</p>","http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/variableselection/selectvariables.aspx?source=wealth-accounting","Time series",NA,"Annual","WLD","National",NA,"Climate Change, Economy & Growth, Energy & Mining, Environment","Annually","April","16-Jun-2017","data@worldbank.org","Bulk download, Query tool","Adjusted Net Savings (Excel)-ZIP (2.6 MB)=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/Wealth-Accounting_excel.zip=excel;Adjusted Net Savings (CSV)-ZIP (969 KB)=http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/Wealth-Accounting_csv.zip=csv",NA,"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/wealth-accounting","26","1970-2015",NA,NA,"43",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"Export Value Added Database","EVAD","<P>The Export Value Added Database provides information on the domestic value-added content of domestic output and exports for 118 countries across 27 sectors of the economy, including 9 commercial services sectors, 3 primary sectors, and 14 manufacturing sectors, spanning intermittent years between 1997 and 2011.</P>

<P>Trade data is usually measured at transaction values, which are gross values, or value added plus domestic and foreign intermediate inputs. The measure of gross exports may undervalue (overvalue) the real contribution of a sector to trade if value added from this sector is embedded as inputs in other sectors’ exports (or overvalue if exports embed other sector’s value added inputs). This is particularly true for services (or manufacturing) exports. Measuring trade on a value-added basis, as achieved in the Export Value Added Database, overcomes this shortcoming. Thus this alternative measure to trade makes explicit the direct value-added contribution of a sector to domestic production as well as exports, as well as the linkages that the sector provides to all other sectors of the economy in terms of value added. This includes both forward linkages-the contribution of a particular sector as an input to others sectors’ exports-and backward linkages- the contribution of all other sectors to a particular sector’s exports.</P>","http://wits.worldbank.org/analyticaldata/redirect2evad.aspx","Cross sectional;Time series",NA,"Annual","WLD","National, Regional","118","Trade","No fixed schedule",NA,"10-May-2016","Sebastian Saez, ssaez@worldbank.org","Bulk download, Query tool","Export Value Added Database (.zip)=http://wits.worldbank.org/data/public/trade/EVAD_February2015.zip;Export Value Added Database (.csv)=http://wits.worldbank.org/data/public/trade/EVAD_February2015.csv",NA,"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/export-value-added","12","1997-2011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Trade in Services Database","TSD","<P>The Trade in Services Database provides information on annual bilateral services trade flows in Mode 1 (cross-border trade) and Mode 2 (consumption abroad) for 199 countries across a multitude of sectors and years spanning 1985 and 2011. The collection of data on cross-border trade in services is notoriously difficult, in large part due to the intangible nature of services but also the high capacity needed to record such data. This is particularly true for developing countries. This database tries to fill this gap by consolidating multiple sources of bilateral trade data in services using mirror techniques, including the OECD, Eurostat, UN and IMF, as to provide a broader coverage of developed and developing countries over time. Mirror-technique is a method to retrieve export trade flows of a reporter by using information on imports of the partner country. </P>
<P>
As a word of caution it should be added that the quality of trade data in services is still far away from being comparable to trade data for merchandise goods. Due to the long tradition of tariff revenues, trade data for goods have been collected with quite high quality and accuracy. Due to intangibility and non-storability of services, at-the-border-duties cannot be applied to services, thus having resulted in much weaker compilation practices with considerably less accuracy. Thus, services statistics has ample space for improvement in terms of measurement. In particular with respect to modes 3 and 4, measurement is up to date difficult and incomplete. Ongoing revisions and refinements of the BOP classification work towards solving these issues. As such, the Trade in Services Database should be seen in this light as the best currently available approximation to a comprehensive picture of global trade flows in services.</P>",NA,"Cross sectional;Time series",NA,"Annual","WLD","National, Regional","195","Trade","Biannually","In the second quarter of every-other fiscal year.","03-Feb-2015","Sebastian Saez, ssaez@worldbank.org","Bulk download","Trade in Services (.zip)=http://wits.worldbank.org/data/public/trade/TSD_February2015.zip;Trade in Services(.csv)=http://wits.worldbank.org/data/public/trade/TSD_February2015.csv",NA,"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/trade-in-services","6","1995-2011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our work includes advising national and local governments on how to improve their investment climate and strengthen basic infrastructure. Governments account for around half of our advisory projects. We also help investment clients improve corporate governance and become more sustainable.

"Education  - Education Implementation Completion Reports",NA,"The World Bank prepares an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for each lending operation it finances. It assesses (a) the degree to which the project achieved its development objective and outputs as set out in the project documents; (b) other significant outcomes and impacts; (c) prospects for the project's sustainability; and (d) Bank and borrower performance, including compliance with relevant Bank safeguard and business policies.  It also provides the data and analysis to substantiate these assessments, and it identifies the lessons learned from implementation. The borrower prepares and provides to the Bank its own evaluation report on the project's execution and initial operation, its cost and the benefits to be derived from it, the Bank's and borrower's performance of their obligations under the Loan Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the loan were achieved.  The borrower's summary of this report (or the full report, if it is 10 pages or fewer) is attached unedited to the ICR.  The borrower also assists the Bank in the preparation of the ICR. An ICR is not prepared for a loan that fails to become effective or is canceled before significant implementation is initiated.  Instead, a Project Completion Note to the Board summarizes the project and explains why it was not implemented.
