Field experience stocktaking - UNHCR V0.1 - Draft Version for peer review - as of 01 March 2021 1 Introduction Official UNHCR guidance on how to measure vulnerability are the following: UNHCR measures indicators of refugee well-being including health and nutrition status, water and sanitation, shel-ter, socio- economic poverty and protection vulnerabilities to guide assistance and solution strategies. Analysis of individual protection vulnerabilities is guided by the Specific Needs approach, which guides case management. UN-HCR Specific Needs codes are outlined in Annex 2. In addition UNHCR promotes the inclusion of refugees into Na-tional Poverty Assessments so as to be able to generate comparable data between refugees and host communities. Comparable socio-economic data is increasingly important to ascertain the level of assistance needed and to inform regional area-based development programs implemented by development and private sector partners together with National Governments as part of the Global Compact for Refugees – UNHCR/WFP Joint Guidance: Targeting of Assistance to Meet Basic Needs This is complemented by the guidance below: Vulnerability analysis framework: The framework defines which households are vulnerable among the entire refugee population. Various socio-economic or sector models can be applied as tools to prioritize who is eligible to receive assistance. An efficient tool for predicting the welfare of all refugee households is econometric welfare modelling. An example can be found in the Vulnerability Assessment Framework in Jordan Targeting: defining eligibility: Anchored in a rights-based approach, the identification and selection of individuals or households for appropriate assistance are based on multi-sectoral analysis of protection risks, wealth and food insecurity, the vulnerability framework and the identified needs. Information from monitoring is analysed and can be used to update targeting eligibility criteria and make other adjustments. – Basic Needs Approach in the Refugee Response WFP has quite detailed guidance around a Consolidated Approach for reporting indicators of food security, (CARI) which allow to define a composite indicator: the “Food Security Index”. In this approach, the theoretical model for the indicator is standardised while there’s aalso a process to customize it according to the context (aka a “calibration”). CARI Food Security Index theoretical model UNHCR Existing Guidance not provide details on how the calculation shall be made. This document build on generic guidance on composite indicator development from the EU-joint Research Center on Composite Indicator and aims at providing a cookbook for field practitioners suggesting a similar approach than WFP, i.e. an harmonized theoretical model paired with a calibration process. This document is build with a reproducible analysis approach, which implies for data expert on the field can simply adapt the scripts included in the documents to the context and data available in their own operations. it includes: An executive summary for Senior Management to understand what they need to know in terms of high level concepts Contextual elements around scoring: why &amp; when, how and risks Hands-on tutorial on how to implement different approach for calibration, using either expert opinions ( budget allocation, conjoint analysis or Analytic hierarchy process) or household survey data (Vulnerability proxy, Deprivation model or Item Response Theory) and to compare the results through a robustness and sensitivity analysis.
