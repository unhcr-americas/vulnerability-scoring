# Introduction
 


Official UNHCR guidance on how to measure vulnerability are the following: 

> UNHCR measures indicators of refugee well-being including health and nutrition status, water and sanitation, shel-ter, socio- economic poverty and protection vulnerabilities to guide assistance and solution strategies. Analysis of individual protection vulnerabilities is guided by the Specific Needs approach, which guides case management. UN-HCR Specific Needs codes are outlined in Annex 2. In addition UNHCR promotes the inclusion of refugees into Na-tional Poverty Assessments so as to be able to generate comparable data between refugees and host communities. Comparable socio-economic data is increasingly important to ascertain the level of assistance needed and to inform regional  area-based  development  programs  implemented  by  development  and  private  sector  partners  together  with National Governments as part of the Global Compact for Refugees

additional guidance mentions the importance of 

>  __Vulnerability analysis framework__: The framework defines which households are vulnerable among the entire refugee population. Various socio-economic or sector models can be applied as tools to prioritize who is eligible to receive assistance. An efficient tool for predicting the welfare of all refugee households is econometric welfare modelling. An example can be found in the Vulnerability Assessment Framework in Jordan

> Targeting; defining eligibilityAnchored in a rights-based approach, the identification and selection of individuals or households for appropriate assistance are based on multi-sectoral analysis of protection risks, wealth and food insecurity,  the vulnerability framework and the identified needs. Information from monitoring is analysed and can be used to update targeting eligibility criteria and make other adjustments.

While WFP has a super detailed guidance for CARI - https://resources.vam.wfp.org/data-analysis/quantitative/food-security/cari-the-consolidated-approach-for-reporting-indicators-of-food-security, our UNHCR Guidance para does not say much about how the calculation shall be made...
