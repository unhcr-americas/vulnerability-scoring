Potential approaches to calibrate scores

## Vulnerability as a latent variable


Vulnerability is not observed, it's a _latent variable_, an intellectual construction based on multiple criteria. 

The challenge is: 

- Define the criteria
- Provide a measurement for each criteria
- Define relative weights to be used for each criteria 

## Avoid compensability effects

Vulnerability scores are composite measurement (cf. [Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators: Methodology and User Guide, OECD/JRC 2008](http://www.oecd.org/sdd/42495745.pdf)) obtained through combination of aggregated and weighted indicators. Due to the very nature of vulnerability, the sub-vulnerability indicators are unlikely to be fully substituable, i.e.  one indicator is unlikely to fully compensate another one. For vulnerability scoring, weights are rather expected to refect the importance of each indicator. Therefore, it is advised to multiply (geometric mean), rather to sum (arithmetic mean) each indicator in order to reflect indicators imperfect substitutability.
 

 

 
The validation of an assistance targeting system could be performed through a detailed analysis of exclusion/exclusion errors between each of the vulnerability scoring approaches.

## What data can be used?

Subjective scoring relies on the input of experts to produce a qualitative judgment. Statistical scoring, on the other hand, relies on quantified characteristics of the prospect’s portfolio history recorded in a database. It uses a set of rules and statistical techniques to forecast risk as a probability.

Statistical scoring models are:• Empirical. Based on a rigorous statistical analysis that derives empirical ways to distinguish between more and less creditworthy consumers using data from applicants within a reasonable preceding period.• Statistically valid. Developed and validated based on generally accepted statistical practices and methodologies.5BENEfItS of crEdIt ScorINg• Periodically revalidated.

### Calibration using expert opinions


First option, weighting sources can be __personal views__ of experts, societal views estimated through surveys or public opinion polls. 


### Calibration using statistically representative dataset


 it's possible to define a __proxy indicator__ for vulnerability (for instance expenditure per capita as used in the Proxy Means Testing, but also Population Group based on a population segmentation exercise) and from there use regression and other predictive models to get a formula. The main limitation from this approach consists in the assumptions behind the quality of the proxy: for instance, an household can have a good income precisely because children in the household are working. The second limitation for this approach are that weight calculated from within the data (i.e based on respondent) as a function of the data-set, meaning the resulting scores are highly dependent on the representativeness of the respondent....

there are other non-subjective weighting schemes (i.e. task of assigning weights), based on data-driven approaches  that do not depend on value judgments or proxies while allowing for analytically sound and transparent process. Though most __data-driven techniques__ such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, Structural Equation Model or Benefit-of-the-Doubt,  assumes the observed variables to be continuous even when they are in fact binary or categorical, as this is the case in most household survey questionnaire (cf.
